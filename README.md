## Translations
To begin with translations, you would first need to familiarize yourself with GitHub first. It's not rocket science.

* Create an account at [GitHub](https://github.com/join) if you don't have an account yet.
* Fork this project.
* A forked project would be available in your own GitHub account.
* Create the necessary language folder.
* Copy the contents from the default en-GB folder and begin translating.
